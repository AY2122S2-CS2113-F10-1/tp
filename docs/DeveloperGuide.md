## Design & implementation

### Implemented Features

#### Todo feature
![image info](./UmlDiagrams/Todo.png)  

**Step1.** When `CommandHandler` receives a user input starting with string “todo”, it will call `toDo()` function to parse the user input into the index of the target `Project` object and one description string.  

**Step2.** If the number of provided arguments is less than the required number, the `toDo()` function will throw an `IllegalCommand` exception and return.  

**Step3.** If no exception is thrown, two strings will be generated by parsing the user input and the `toDo()` function will pass the two arguments to `projectList` for creating and adding a `Todo` object to a `Project` object.  

**Step4.** When `projectList` receives the call, it will get the target `Project` object and pass the description string to it.  

**Step5.** The `Project` object will create a `Todo` object and add it to the `ArrayList<Todo>` in `Project` class.  


### Proposed Features

#### Parse Command Feature
![image info](./UmlDiagrams/CommandParser.png)  

The proposed parse command feature makes use of CommandParser and its subclasses, and Command and its subclasses.  
In the version 1.0 we simply used CommandHandler to parse user input for different commands, which may lead to violation of single responsibility principle. The proposed implementation will implement one command parser for each command (e.g. AddProjectCommand will have a paser named AddProjectCommandParser).  

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command parser behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user inputs command. The command is retrieved by `handleUserInput()` in `CommandHandler`.  

**Step 2.** `handleUserInput()` will check command type and create a new `CommandParser` object and call `parse()` in `CommandParser`.  

**Step 3.** `CommandParser` will check if the input can be parsed into a valid command. If it fails, it will throw exceptions. After parsing the user’s input, `CommandParser` will create a new `Command` object and return it back to `CommandHandler`.  

**Step 4.** `CommandHandler` will call `executeCommand()` in its own class to execute the returned command.

### Value proposition

CSProjPlanner provides a project management and scheduling system geared toward Computer Science students and utilises a text UI interface. 
While providing CS students a convenient way to keep track and store all relevant information, links, and deadlines for their projects, 
the program also allows for faster searching and editing than a GUI design once the user is familiar with the commands—a concept CS students are far too familiar with.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
