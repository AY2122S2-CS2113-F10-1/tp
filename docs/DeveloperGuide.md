## Design & implementation

### Implemented Features

#### Todo feature implementation
![image info](./UmlDiagrams/Todo.png)
**Step1.** When `CommandHandler` receives a user input starting with string “todo”, it will call `toDo()` function to parse the user input into the index of the target `Project` object and one description string.  
**Step2.** If the number of provided arguments is less than the required number, the `toDo()` function will throw an `IllegalCommand` exception and return.  
**Step3.** If no exception is thrown, two strings will be generated by parsing the user input and the `toDo()` function will pass the two arguments to `projectList` for creating and adding a `Todo` object to a `Project` object.  
**Step4.** When `projectList` receives the call, it will get the target `Project` object and pass the description string to it.  
**Step5.** The `Project` object will create a `Todo` object and add it to the `ArrayList<Todo>` in `Project` class.

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
